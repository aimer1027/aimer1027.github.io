You will take the first turn to remove the stones.<br/>\r\n\r\nBoth of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. <br/>\r\nWrite a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.<br/>\r\n\r\nFor example, if there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game: <br/>\r\nno matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be removed by your friend.<br/>\r\n\r\nsource code:\r\n\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nclass Solution {\r\npublic:\r\n    bool canWinNim(int n) {\r\n        if(n%4==0)\r\n            return false ;\r\n        else \r\n            return true ;\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
